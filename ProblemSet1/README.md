 \**Problem Sets*
 
The pseudocode is giving a set of **if**, and **else if** statements to find Smith in the phone book. The code tells how to get to Smith by constantly halfing the amount of pages the Smith name could be in. Once Smith is found, it gives instructions to call Mike.
 </p>  If Smith can not be found in the phone book, the pseudocode instructs the user to quit the search.
