### Design Decisions

My original plan for my project was to create a script that fully maps the Ableton Push for Bitiwg. This became a lot more consuming as time went on. I ended up making a few compromises durring the development process. I placed most of my focus on the basic controls of the Push like the transport controls and basic midi implementation. I succeeded in creating these more basic functions.

For a large part of the development, I used DrivenByMoss's tutorials on the Bitwig Api. A segment of my code is designed almost identicially to how he teaches in his videos. Where we diverge is in the controllers we designed the scripts for and the specific controlls I had to implement for the Ableton Push. I also did a lot of research into the Ableton Push 2's documentaition.
