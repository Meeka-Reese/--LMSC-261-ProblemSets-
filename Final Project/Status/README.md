#### Pushig Bitwig


#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've implemented midi functionality between the Ableton Push and Bitwig through the pads and the transport control

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I'm still working on getting the pads to light up right. My program isn't sending midi back to the Push right yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The biggest problem that I've encountered is that the push uses cc for the transport buttons. This made me learn about a couple new functions in the Bitwig api to be able to get the program to work.
