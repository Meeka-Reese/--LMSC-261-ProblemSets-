# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pushing Bitwig

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

I'm interested in the Bitiwig modding community, so for my final project, I would like to create a Bitwig extension that lets me display images on my Ableton Push screen.

## Detail your project in a paragraph or more. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My extension will make my Ableton Push a versatile midi controller in Bitwig with controller scripts.

## If you plan to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's project, which other course? Which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to LMSC-261, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?

This project would connect somewhat to the website we made in HTML, since Bitwig extensions are mostly comprised of javascript.

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than expected. And it is common to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what **WILL** you accomplish no matter what?

My bair minimum needs for this project are to get midi output working, the Push pad lights working, and transport controls working.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you **THINK** you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?


- midi repeat with the pushes repeat buttons
- midi i/o
- pad lights
- transport controls


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a **BEST** outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Control plugin preset with toggle buttons
- midi repeat with the pushes repeat buttons
- midi i/o
- pad lights
- transport controls
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

My next steps are to study the Bitwig API through [*this series of videos*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4AuiQ8krQc&list=PLqRWeSPiYQ66KBGONBenPv1O3luQCFQR2&ab_channel=J%C3%BCrgenMo%C3%9Fgraber)
